% Neuralynx head direction recordings often have missed samples, registered
% as either 0 or NaN. This script finds all missed samples and accidental
% flips of 180 degree (or any large flips > 162 degress) that persist for more than int
% 'max_allowed_flips' (5 samples) and interpolates the directional data
% in-between. Then we smooth the vector by convolving it with a gaussian of
% standard deviation of 3 bins, (or .1 sec at 30hz sampling freq).
%
% For all numerical samples (0 excluded) we continuize the data so
% that there are no more jumps at 360 and 0, and linearly interpolate all
% areas of bad data (either large angular velocities or 450s, NaNs, or
% zeros) that are 'max_allowed_flips' or less. Then smooth, and bring back
% to [-180,180).
