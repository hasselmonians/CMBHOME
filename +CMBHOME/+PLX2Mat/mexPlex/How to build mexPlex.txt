How to Build and Verify mexPlex
-------------------------------

If ReadingPLXandDDTfilesinMatlab-mexw.zip was inzipped to

C:\PlexonMatlab

make sure that Matlab's current directory is

C:\PlexonMatlab\OfflineSDK\mexPlex

In Matlab, run:

res = build_and_verify_mexPlex()

If res is 1, all the tests passed.

If you want to build mexPlex without verification, run this in Matlab:

mex -output mexPlex -outdir .. PlexMethods.cpp

If you have problems compiling mex files in Matlab under Ubuntu, you may want to look at this page:
